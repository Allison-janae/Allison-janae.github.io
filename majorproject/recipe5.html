                    <ul>
                        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour or whole wheat flour (spooned & leveled)</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup Panko bread crumbs</li>
                        <li>1 cup sweetened shredded coconut</li>
                        <li>1 pound raw large shrimp, peeled and deveined with tails attached</li>
                        <li>3–4 Tablespoons vegetable oil or coconut oil (or olive oil)*</li>
                        <li>optional for topping: 1 Tablespoon finely chopped cilantro</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the Shrimp:
                            <li>Freezing Instructions: Fried coconut shrimp freezes well, up to 2 months. Reheat for 10
                                minutes in a 350°F (177°C) oven or until thawed and warm.</li>
                            <li>Special Tools: Glass Mixing Bowls | Large Skillet | Tongs</li>

                            <li>Shrimp: Large + raw shrimp with tails attached are best for this coconut shrimp recipe.
                                If
                                frozen, thaw before starting. I recommend getting them peeled and deveined because that
                                will
                                save you time at home. I recommend tails attached because the coconut shrimp are easy to
                                prep, coat, and handle as an appetizer that way. Feel free to remove the tails before
                                starting if desired. Can I use frozen cooked shrimp? Yes, you can use frozen cooked
                                shrimp
                                in this recipe but starting with raw shrimp is best. Thaw, then use in this recipe as
                                directed.</li>
                            <li>Oil: I prefer frying the coconut shrimp in coconut oil for the best taste. You need
                                enough
                                to coat the bottom of your skillet, usually about 3 Tablespoons or close to 4.</li>
                            <li>Serving Sauce: We’ve also tried and loved this dipping sauce too.</li>
