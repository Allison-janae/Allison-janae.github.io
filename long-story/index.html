            <p>In 1941, Leningrad was under siege. Food was scarce, and winter bit through the city’s walls. A young bell-ringer named Ivan watched the world grow colder, wondering if the city would survive.</p>

            <p>The mayor ordered all large church bells melted to make cannons. Ivan faced a choice: obey the order or save the bells that had sounded for generations. Every bell was a memory of hope, of weddings, of festivals.</p>
