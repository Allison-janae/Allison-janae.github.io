    <h1>
        Code Log 4 - CSS Color
    </h1>

    <p>
        <p1>
            CSS uses color to differentiate html elements, and it allows us to control the appearance of content
            by applying colors to different content such as text, background, and borders.
        </p1>
    </p>

    <p>
        <p2>
            Color values in CSS allow you to change the color of elements such as text an example of this is:
            p {
            color: red;
            }
        </p2>
    </p>

    <p>
        <p3>
            You can also change the color of the background an example of this is: div {
            background-color: lightblue;
            }
        </p3>
    </p>

    <p>
        <p4>
            You can also change the color of a border: div {
            border: 2px solid;
            border-color; green:
            }
        </p4>
    </p>

    <p>
        CSS also allows you to have colors in different formats, which allows you to be flexible when designing.
    </p>

    <p> <p5>
        One way of doing this is by just using the colors name blue, pink, and yellow. color: pink;
    </p>  </p5>

    <p> <p6>
        A different way this can be done is by
        using hexadecimal colors this would show up by using a hashtag followed by 3 or 6 digits, an exaple of this is
        color: #ff0000 which would be red.
    </p> </p6>

    <p> <p7>
        The third way of using colors when coding is by RGB which is red, blue, and green components
        that are numbers betweeen 0-255. An example of using RGB is color: rgb (255, 0, 0); which is red.
    </p> </p7>

    <p> <p8>
        The fourth way this can
        be done differently is RGBA colors this is the same as RBG but includes a fourth value for opacity where 0 is
        fully transaprent
        and 1 is fully opaque. Doing this method would show up like this background-color: rgba: (0, 0, 255, 0.5); which
        would be a semi-transparent blue.
    </p> </p8>
