        CSS Media Queries
    </h1>

    <p>
        A CSS media query allows you to apply different styles to different device or screen sizes. 
        It does this by checking the screen width, height, resolution etc and then it applies the CSS rules based on the characteristics give.
        CSS queries are useful because they can tailor different styles to different devices, you can increase sizing for smaller devices, and you can make a site more compatible with what you are using.
    </p>

	<p>
		A few media features that are supported by media queries are max-width, orientation, prefers-color-scheme, and min-resolution.
		Max width targets devices with a width less than or equal to the specified value, while orientation will align with the device and make it taller than wide, or wider than tall.
		The prefers-color-scheme will detect if theres a light or dark theme of a certain broswer, and the min-resolution will will target the minnnimum pixel density.

		Example of how to use these if they were placed in the CSS: (These would also be targeted to what your wanting to change specifically)
	</h2>

	<p>
		<textarea>
			@media (max-width: 500px)
			@media (orientation: landscape)
			@media (min-resolution: 2dppx)
			@media (preferred-color-scheme: dark)
		</textarea>
