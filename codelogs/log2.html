    <h1>CSS Measuring Units</h1>

    <p>Absolute and relative CSS length units are units used to define sizes like margins,
        padding, font sizes, widths, and more. These units can be categorized into two main types: absolute and relative
        units. </p>
   
     <p> Absolute units are are fixed and not affected by other elements or the user's settings. 
        They are best used when you want elements to have a specific, unchanging size. An example of absolute units are 
        px: Pixels, in: Inches, and cm: Centimeters. These are used when writing or laying things out in a controlled precise way. </p>
