 <h1>CSS Measuring Units</h1>

    <p>Absolute and relative CSS length units are units used to define sizes like margins,
        padding, font sizes, widths, and more. These units can be categorized into two main types: absolute and relative
        units. </p>
   
     <p> Absolute units are are fixed and not affected by other elements or the user's settings. 
        They are best used when you want elements to have a specific, unchanging size. An example of absolute units are Pixels and Inches, These are used when writing or laying things out in a controlled and precise way. </p>

        <p>
            Example of using the code- 
        </p>

        <p> Relative units are based on other values, such as the size of the root element, They are flexible and scale better across different devices and screen sizes.
            An example of this is rem, which is the font size of an element. </p>
