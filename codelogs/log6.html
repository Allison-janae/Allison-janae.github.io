    <h1>For this code log I decided to research four different recources on the CSS property "media Queries" which is a
        responisve design rule. </h1>
    <p>
        The first source I looked at was W3Schools, in the search bar I enetered "CSS Media Queries" which then gave me
        this: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp" target="_blank">CSS Media Queries -
            W3Schools</a>
            
        This site gave a definition, syntax, media types, features, and examples. It also allows you to try it yourself
        and gives you exercises on it to practice. I think this site gives you a lot of information and examples to
        futher your understanding.
    </p>

        The second source I looked at was CSS Tricks, in the search bar I entered "Media Queries" which then gave me
        this: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/" targett="_blanks">CSS Media Queries Guide - CSS Tricks</a>
