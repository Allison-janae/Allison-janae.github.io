    <h1>For this code log I decided to research four different recources on the CSS property "media Queries" which is a
        responisve design rule. </h1>
    <p>
        The first source I looked at was W3Schools, in the search bar I enetered "CSS Media Queries" which then gave me
        this: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp" target="_blank">CSS Media Queries -
            W3Schools</a>

        This site gave a definition, syntax, media types, features, and examples. It also allows you to try it yourself
        and gives you exercises on it to practice. I think this site gives you a lot of information and examples to
        futher your understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second source I looked at was CSS Tricks, in the search bar I entered "Media Queries" which then gave me
        this: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/" targett="_blanks">CSS Media
            Queries Guide - CSS Tricks</a>
        This site also gave me a definition, other places i can use it in, the anatomy, value ranges, nesting,
        accesibility, and browser support. It didn't give me a way to try it out but it did give many examples with
        pictures as well. I overall liked this site I do wish it let you practice the code a bit.
    </p>

        The third source I looked at was Mozilla Develper Network, In the search bar I entered "media queries" where it
        then gave me this: <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Media_queries"
            target="_blanks"> Media Query Fundamentals - (MDN)</a>
