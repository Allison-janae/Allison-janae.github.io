    <h1>For this code log I decided to research four different recources on the CSS property "media Queries" which is a
        responisve design rule. </h1>
    <p>
        The first source I looked at was W3Schools, in the search bar I enetered "CSS Media Queries" which then gave me
        this: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp" target="_blank">CSS Media Queries -
            W3Schools</a>
        This site gave a definition, syntax, media types, features, and examples. It also allows you to try it yourself
        and gives you exercises on it to practice. I think this site gives you a lot of information and examples to
        futher your understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second source I looked at was CSS Tricks, in the search bar I entered "Media Queries" which then gave me
        this: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/" targett="_blanks">CSS Media
            Queries Guide - CSS Tricks</a>
        This site also gave me a definition, other places i can use it in, the anatomy, value ranges, nesting,
        accesibility, and browser support. It didn't give me a way to try it out but it did give many examples with
        pictures as well. I overall liked this site I do wish it let you practice the code a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The third source I looked at was Mozilla Develper Network, In the search bar I entered "media queries" where it
        then gave me this: <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Media_queries"
            target="_blanks"> Media Query Fundamentals - (MDN)</a>
        This site gave a definition, a learning goal, basics, rules, orientation, syntax, mobile desing, and coloumn
        layouts. I think what stood out to me the most is that this site had alot of information and even showed how you
        can do different layouts and designs.
    </p>
    <p>

        The final sourcce I looked at was DevDocs, and in the search bar I entered "media Queries" where it gave me
        this: <a href="https://devdocs.io/css/css_media_queries" target="_blanks">Media Queries - Dev Docs</a>
        This page gave me a definition, rules, descriptors, guides, and related concepts. This site wasn't my favorite I
        didn't really think it gave me all the useful information and wanted to direct me to another page for certain
        information. It also has no examples on the main page.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think for the most part I liked all of the recources except for DevDocs. I think all of them were pretty
        similar other than that. I do think a reference should have a good amount of examples and show you different
        ways a code it usually done or needed for. I especially thought it was useful to have the mobile design and
        coloumn layout reference.
