    <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>

    <p> Semantic tags are tags that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. These tags
        convey structure and purpose both to developers and browsers/search engines. Examples of these are headers,
        articles, sections, and footers. Sematic tags are good to use for structure and accessability.
        Non sematic tags do not describe their contentâ€™s meaning. They serve only as containers. These tags require
        classes or IDs to describe their purpose, an example of these are divs and spans.
