    <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>

    <p> Semantic tags are tags that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. These tags
        convey structure and purpose both to developers and browsers/search engines. Examples of these are headers,
        articles, sections, and footers. Sematic tags are good to use for structure and accessability.
        Non sematic tags do not describe their contentâ€™s meaning. They serve only as containers. These tags require
        classes or IDs to describe their purpose, an example of these are divs and spans.
    </p>

    <p>Let's say the assignment asks about the fictional HTML tag called "Kiwi". Here are some ways to include code on
        the page.</p>

    <p>Let's say the assignment needs you to include some sample code. Here's how to do it: use the textarea tag.</p>

    <textarea cols="50" rows="3">
        <kiwi>this is not a real tag.</kiwi>
    </textarea>

    <hr>

    <h2>Other tags you can use.</h2>

    <p>As you are writing your response, feel free to use lists, tables, and other HTML elements: </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Lists</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Headlines like h1, h2, etc.</li>
        <li>Paragraphs</li>
        <li>Any other HTML tags</li>
        <li>Horizontal rules like hr</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also add as much CSS as you want. Or as little. It is up to you.</p>

    <p>Finally, if you want to simulate the apperance of a tag, use the <code>&lt;</code>code> and <code>&gt;</code> and
        characters
    <p>
