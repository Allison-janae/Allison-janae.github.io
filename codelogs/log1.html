    <h1>Code Log 1: CSS Measuring Units</h1>

    <p>Absolute units are fixed and not affected by other elements or the user's settings. They are best used when you
        want elements to have a specific, unchanging size. An example of an absolute unit would be px, which is pixels that are 1/96 of 1 inch.</p>
        
        <p>Relative units are based on other values, such as the size of the parent element, the root element, or the
        viewport. They are flexible and scale better across different devices and screen sizes.</p>

    <p>Let's say the assignment asks about the fictional HTML tag called "Kiwi". Here are some ways to include code on
        the page.</p>

    <p>Let's say the assignment needs you to include some sample code. Here's how to do it: use the textarea tag.</p>

    <textarea cols="50" rows="3">
        <kiwi>this is not a real tag.</kiwi>
    </textarea>

    <hr>

    <h2>Other tags you can use.</h2>

    <p>As you are writing your response, feel free to use lists, tables, and other HTML elements: </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Lists</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Headlines like h1, h2, etc.</li>
        <li>Paragraphs</li>
        <li>Any other HTML tags</li>
        <li>Horizontal rules like hr</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also add as much CSS as you want. Or as little. It is up to you.</p>

    <p>Finally, if you want to simulate the apperance of a tag, use the <code>&lt;</code>code> and <code>&gt;</code> and
        characters
    <p>
